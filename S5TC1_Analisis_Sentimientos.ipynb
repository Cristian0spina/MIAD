Cada observación contiene si el sentimiento de los tweets es positivo, neutral o negativo teniendo en cuenta distintas variables como aerolínea y las razones de los sentimientos negativos (como \"retraso en el vuelo\" o \"servicio grosero\"). El objetivo es predecir el sentimiento asociado a cada tweet. Para más detalles pueden visitar el siguiente enlace: [datos](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment)."
